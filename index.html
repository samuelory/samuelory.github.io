        <h2> About Me</h2>I am a 16 year old student currently studying in Raffles Institution. <br>
        My class is 19s06E and my CCA is the Boys' Brigade. I was in the computer elective programme<br> 
        in year 3 to 4, and my favourite coding language is python.</p></marquee></marquee>

        <h2>
          About my Project Idea
        </h2> My idea is to allow users to use their phones as the vibrating token thingy that food stalls<br> 
        use to inform customers that their food is here. Since the vibrating token is no longer something<br>
        that the customers have to return, the customer is no longer expected to stay in the area after joining the queue. <br>
        As such, the customer can join the queue, then leave and come back when it his turn.
